abstract = {We propose to use new orthonormal wavelet packet bases, more efficient than the Fourier basis, to compress two-dimensional turbulent flows. We define the “best basis” of wavelet packets as the one which, for a given enstrophy density, condenses the L2 norm into a minimum number of non-negligible wavelet packet coefficients. Coefficients below a threshold are discarded, reducing the number of degrees of freedom. We then compare the predictability of the original flow evolution with several such reductions, varying the number of retained coefficients, either from a Fourier basis, or from the best-basis of wavelet packets. We show that for a compression ratio of 1/2, we still have a deterministic predictability using the wavelet packet best-basis, while it is lost when using the Fourier basis. Likewise, for compression ratios of 1/20 and 1/200 we still have statistical predictability using the wavelet packet best-basis, while it is lost when using the Fourier basis. In fact, the significant wavelet packet coefficients in the best-basis appear to correspond to coherent structures. The weak coefficients correspond to vorticity filaments, which are only passively advected by the coherent structures. In conclusion, the wavelet packet best-basis seems to distinguish the low-dimensional dynamically active part of the flow from the high-dimensional passive components. It gives us some hope of drastically reducing the number of degrees of freedom necessary to the computation of two-dimensional turbulent flows.}

	Abstract = {In this paper we discuss smooth local trigonometric bases. We present two generalizations of the orthogonal basis of Malvar and Coifman-Meyer: biorthogonal and equal parity bases. These allow natural representations of constant and, sometimes, linear components. We study and compare their approximation properties and applicability in data compression. This is illustrated with numerical examples.},

   ABSTRACT   = {Mallat's book is the undisputed reference in this field - it is the only one that covers the essential material in such breadth and depth. - Laurent Demanet, Stanford UniversityThe new edition of this classic book gives all the major concepts, techniques and applications of sparse representation, reflecting the key role the subject plays in today's signal processing. The book clearly presents the standard representations with Fourier, wavelet and time-frequency transforms, and the construction of orthogonal bases with fast algorithms. The central concept of sparsity is explained and applied to signal compression, noise reduction, and inverse problems, while coverage is given to sparse representations in redundant dictionaries, super-resolution and compressive sensing applications.Features:* Balances presentation of the mathematics with applications to signal processing* Algorithms and numerical examples are implemented in WaveLab, a MATLAB toolbox* Companion website for instructors and selected solutions and code available for studentsNew in this edition* Sparse signal representations in dictionaries* Compressive sensing, super-resolution and source separation* Geometric image processing with curvelets and bandlets* Wavelets for computer graphics with lifting on surfaces* Time-frequency audio processing and denoising* Image compression with JPEG-2000* New and updated exercisesA Wavelet Tour of Signal Processing: The Sparse Way, third edition, is an invaluable resource for researchers and R&D engineers wishing to apply the theory in fields such as image processing, video processing and compression, bio-sensing, medical imaging, machine vision and communications engineering.Stephane Mallat is Professor in Applied Mathematics at cole Polytechnique, Paris, France.
