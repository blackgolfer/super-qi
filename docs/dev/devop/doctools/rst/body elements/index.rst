Body elements are big group of various elements that serve as a container
for another body or inline elements like strong, inline image, etc.
They create “blocks” with usually entire available width and height equal to
its child elements.

Body elements contains two types of elements: block and inline-level.

Block-level elements appear in the text as the rectangular objects which
do no break across lines. Examples of block elements: section title,
paragraph, bullet list, and many more.

Inline elements are part of the document text flow and they do break across
lines. Inlines are e.g. emphasis (italic), strong emphasis (bold), inline
literal (code example in monospace font) and few more.
