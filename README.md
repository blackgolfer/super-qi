## Time series analysis
### Time frequency analysis
   1. From Fourier to Wavelet: time frequency localization
   2. Multiresolution analysis
   3. Time-frequency visualization: Wigner-Ville distribution
   4. Adaptivity
      - sparsity
      - best basis
      - matching pursuit

### Classification
   1. Stock price state model
   2. Wavelet scattering
   3. State classification
      - wavelet scattering
      - state dependent factor analysis

### Forecasting
   1. forecasting within 0 state
   2. forecasting within 1 state
   3. forecasting wihtin -1 state
   4. the case of multi-timescale

## Game theory
### Single asset strategy composition
### Multi-asset composition
### State dependent factor investing
