    "The top level of a module contains any of the various declarations we have discussed: fixity declarations, data and type declarations, class and instance declarations, type signatures, function definitions, and pattern bindings. Except for the fact that import declarations (to be described shortly) must appear first, the declarations may appear in any order (the top-level scope is mutually recursive).\n",
    "\n",
    "Haskell's module design is relatively conservative: the name-space of modules is completely flat, and modules are in no way \"first-class.\" Module names are alphanumeric and must begin with an uppercase letter. There is no formal connection between a Haskell module and the file system that would (typically) support it. In particular, there is no connection between module names and file names, and more than one module could conceivably reside in a single file (one module may even span several files). Of course, a particular implementation will most likely adopt conventions that make the connection between modules and files more stringent.\n",
